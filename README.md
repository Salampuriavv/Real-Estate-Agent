## üîß How It Works

- **Image Processing:** When an image is uploaded, the system uses **BLIP (Salesforce image captioning)** to generate a description of the image. This description helps identify the type of property issue.
- **Query Handling:** The system intelligently detects whether the input requires property issue troubleshooting or legal tenancy advice, and routes the request to the appropriate agent.
- **Language Model Responses:** The agents are powered by **OpenAI's GPT** to generate human-like responses for property issues and legal advice.

## üìú FAQs

### **1. Can I ask about any property issue?**
Yes! You can ask about various property concerns, such as mold, leaks, damages, or structural issues. Upload an image, and the agent will assist you based on the description generated from the image.

### **2. How does the tenancy law agent work?**
The chatbot can provide advice on tenancy laws, including eviction notices, rent disputes, deposits, and landlord-tenant agreements. Just type your question, and the system will provide a detailed response based on the context.

### **3. What kind of images should I upload?**
You can upload images of properties that may have visible issues like damage, leaks, or mold. The clearer the image, the better the model will interpret and diagnose the problem.
